#len()
- The len() function returns the number of items in an object. When the object is a string, the len() function returns the number of characters in the string.

#min () and max.
- The min() function returns the item with the lowest value, or the item with the lowest value in an iterable. If the values are strings, an alphabetically comparison is done.
- The max() function returns the item with the highest value, or the item with the highest value in an iterable. If the values are strings, an alphabetically comparison is done.

#count ()
- The count() method returns the number of elements with the specified value or the number of times a specified value appears in the string.

#Merging (+) dan Replication (*)
- To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.
- To double or more strings, you can use the * operator.

#Range()
- The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

#In and Not In
- When used in a condition, the statement returns a Boolean result evaluating into either True or False. When the specified value is found inside the sequence, the statement returns True. Whereas when it is not found, we get a False.

#Giving value in multiple variable
- Python has the best practical way. We can give values in multiple variables from list and tuple elements. The amount of variable and item must have same amount and we can change two or more variables
